# ECE 5755/CS 5754: Modern Computer Architecture and Systems (Fall 2025)

## Description

This graduate level course is designed to provide a hardware-centric overview
of computer systems used in modern computing platforms. From the bottom up we
will study the architecture of processor architectures (e.g., pipelined CPUs,
ISA, RISC vs. CISC, out-of-order execution) and memory systems (e.g., memory
hierarchy, caching, DRAM memories). We will understand how to evaluate the
performance of modern processors and exploit parallelism in applications. This
includes parallelization across multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and specialized
hardware. Through hands-on assignments and an open-ended project students will
develop a holistic understanding of modern computer systems and how they are
designed.
